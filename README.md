# SearchPal-RegEx (WIP)
A Chrome extension for searching web pages using regular expressions

## Why?
I use the standard Chrome search functionality quite a lot, but one day I wondered whether it was possible to search using regex.
After some searching I discovered that it wasn't possible, and decided that this is something that I really could use, so
I decided to try and make it myself.

## How?
The extension will be built(like other extensions) using HTML, CSS and (native)JavaScript.
